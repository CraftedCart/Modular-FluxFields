A Minecraft Mod that adds forcefields to protect your base!

## Requirements
As of v1.0 alpha 3, the Slick-Util library is needed to run Modular Fluxfields. That is automatically downloaded when you launch Minecraft with Modular FluxFields for the first time. If the download fails however, manual installation instructions can be found [here](http://craftedcart.github.io/Modular-FluxFields/documentation/manualDepInstall.html).

Submit an issue report! Please make sure that you're using the latest version though. Your issue may have been patched already.
