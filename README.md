Modular FluxFields
==================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CraftedCart/Modular-FluxFields.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/CraftedCart/Modular-FluxFields)

A Minecraft Mod that adds forcefields to protect your base!

## Requirements
As of v1.0 alpha 3, the Slick-Util library is needed to run Modular Fluxfields. The download for that can be found [here](http://slick.ninjacave.com/slick-util.jar). Throw that jar file into your mods folder, and you hopefully shouldn't crash.

## Found something wrong?
Submit an issue report! Please make sure that you're using the latest version though. Your issue may have been patched already.
